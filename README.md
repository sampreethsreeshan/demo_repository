# A demo repository

This repository was created locally. Created as part of learning to use Git commands.

## Demonstration of the idea of a branch

1) I made some changes in the 'feature-readme-instructions' branch. I want to show that unless I merge it with the main branch, these changes remains only in the branch.
2) As per the requests of the reviewer, I am adding a line that says that this branch will now be merged with the main branch.
